User Scoring

- keep record of all scoring events

- how to handle "undoing" a score (i.e. user upvotes and then retracts)

  if we want to purge undone scores from scoring history report,
  we need a key for all scoring transactions that can be referencing for undoing
  ex: addScore(forUserID, fromUserID, entityType, entityID, scoreTrans, score)
  if user 1 upvotes a post from user 2:
    addScore(2, 1, post, postID, vote, 1)
  no, we can check scoring transaction table for
    (forUserID, fromUserID, entityType, entityID, scoreTrans )
  if a record exists, then 


Editing

- updating a post can be tricky if the post type is changed
  this may result in invalid links
