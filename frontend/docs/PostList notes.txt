PostList Notes

- list is driven by order, start, entryTypeID, substanceIDs, conditionIDs
- we want url to drive these parameters, and we want filter to be remembered
- but there are situations where this is tricky:
  a) bookmark should override/reset filter settings
  b) viewing "trending" with filter and then selecting "new" should leave filter in tact

to accommodate both a and b, we have two options:
OPTION 1: nav must be filter aware so that url in nav has filter settings
  in which case postlist can always filter based on url
OPTION 2: nav url doesn't have filter settings
  in which postlist needs logic to know when to retrieve filter settings from localstorage

for options 2, how would postlist know when to use url settings vs stored settings?

lets consider all postlist entry points (i.e. things that cause postlist to rerender):
    enty points from when postlist is already mounted:
        nav link when already viewing postlist (ie. switching from trending to new)
        apply filter (causes nav)
        more link (causes nav)
        updatevote
        logging in

    entry posts that cause postlist to remount:
        bookmark
        nav link when not already viewing postlist (i.e. when viewing help)
        add post (causes nav)

solution for option 2:
    if filter params in url, use those params (and write them to local storage)
    if no filter params in url
        if filter params in local storage, renav to postlist with params in url
        if no filter params in local storage, retrieve data with no filter

let's see how this works for all entry points:
    enty points from when postlist is already mounted:
        nav link: no url params
        apply filter: url params present
        more link: url params present
        updatevote: url params present
        logging in: url params present

    entry posts that cause postlist to remount:
        bookmark: url params present
        nav link: no url params
        add post: no url params

so only times no url params present are:
        nav link
        add post

in both cases, postlist will correctly check local storage and either renav or load accordingly

-----------------------------

input params are: order, start, entryTypeID, substanceIDs, conditionIDs
postist always pulls filter from url and updates localstorage
filter is always applied via applyFilter
applyFilter will always update localstorage with params before renavigating
renavigating will always cause nav to rerender
nav should therefore always pull filter params from localstorage

nav must know to rerender when coming in from bookmark
here's what happens if nav doesn't do so:
    nav pulls (old) filter params from localstorage 
    postlist pulls new filterparams from url
    postlist updates localstorage, but nav has already used old params
so we create a query param called "filterupdateseq" that updates when new filter params are saved to local storage
that causes the following sequence:
    nav pulls (old) filter params from localstorage 
    postlist pulls new filterparams from url
    postlist updates localstorage
    postlist renavigates with new filterupdateseq
    nav now rerenders and pulls new filter params from localstorage
note that nav effect depends on filterupdateseq, but postlist should not
(we don't want postlist to re-retrieve postlist after renav with new filterupdateseq)

- inputs to PostListFilter:
  methods: applyFilter, hideFilter
  props: entryTypeIDs, substanceIDs, conditionIDs (comma separated list)

- effects of applying PostListFilter
  local storage updated with filter values
  url updated with filter values (which in turn updates PostList)
